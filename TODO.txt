* Import/Upgrade my old tests.
* Move all core extensions to modules so that they can be optionally extended by an object
  or included by a non-core class.
* Would be nice to:
** Detect if the included file will overwrite existing methods.
** Provide aliasing for methods to avoid method name clashes.
** Provide a sake-like way for easily sharing/installing your methods with others.
** Extend this system for non-core classes ie some Rails classes.
